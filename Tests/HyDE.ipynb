      "To complete the Brandeis computer science major, you will need to take a set of core classes as well as elective courses. The specific classes required may vary depending on the year you entered the program and any updates to the curriculum. However, I can provide you with a general overview of the types of classes you can expect to take:\n",

      "2. **Mathematics Courses**: Computer science is closely related to mathematics, so you will likely need to take courses in areas such as calculus, discrete mathematics, and linear algebra.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Elective Computer Science Courses**: You will have the opportunity to choose elective courses based on your interests and career goals. These may include topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, databases, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Senior Capstone Project**: Many computer science programs require a senior capstone project where you work on a real-world problem or research project under the guidance of a faculty member.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **General Education Requirements**: In addition to computer science courses, you will also need to fulfill general education requirements in areas such as writing, humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to consult with your academic advisor or refer to the official Brandeis computer science major requirements to get the most up-to-date and accurate information on the specific classes you need to complete the program. Additionally, you may want to consider exploring opportunities for internships, research projects, or extracurricular activities related to computer science to enhance your learning experience and prepare for your future career.\n"
